## To replace flannel with your own CNI plugin
0. Remove the following BOSH jobs:
  - `cni-flannel`
  - `vxlan-policy-agent`
0. Remove the following BOSH packages:
  - `flannel`
  - `flannel-watchdog`
0. Add in all packages and jobs required by your CNI plugin.  At a minimum, you must provide a CNI binary program and a CNI config file.
  - For more info on **bosh packaging scripts** read [this](http://bosh.io/docs/packages.html#create-a-packaging-script).
  - For more info on **bosh jobs** read [this](http://bosh.io/docs/jobs.html).
0. Update the [deployment manifest properties](http://bosh.io/docs/deployment-manifest.html#properties)

  ```yaml
  garden-cni:
    adapter:
      cni_plugin_dir: /var/vcap/packages/YOUR_PACKAGE/bin # your CNI binary goes in this directory
      cni_config_dir: /var/vcap/jobs/YOUR_JOB/config/cni  # your CNI config file goes in this directory
  ```
  Remove any lingering references to `flannel` or `cni-flannel` in the deployment manifest.

## To deploy a local-only (no-op) CNI plugin
As a baseline, you can deploy using only the basic [bridge CNI plugin](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/Documentation/bridge.md).

This plugin will provide connectivity between containers on the same Garden host (Diego cell)
but will not provide a cross-host network.  However, it can be a useful baseline configuration for
testing and development.

```bash
cd bosh-lite
bosh target lite
bosh update cloud-config cloud-config.yml
bosh deployment local-only.yml
bosh deploy
```

## To deploy diego with CNI but without cross-host container networking
For generating a cloudfoundry-diego deployment without container to container connectivity, but using the CNI bridge plugin for NAT'ed connectivity.

```bash
CNI_BRIDGE=true ./scripts/generate-bosh-lite-manifests
bosh deploy
```
