    description: "Port that Envoy proxy is listening on. Redirect NAT rules will be created to transparently pass packets to the proxy."

  proxy_range:
    description: |
      CIDR of the application container network.
      Traffic destined for this range will be proxied through Envoy.
      If using silk release, or any release that provides a `cf_network` link
      with `cf_network.network` property, this is optional.
      If no link is provided, this property is required.
      Specifying this property supersedes a provided link value.
