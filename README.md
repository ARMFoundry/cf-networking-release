# CF Networking Release

CF Networking provides policy-based container networking for Cloud Foundry.

CF Networking integrates with [Garden-runC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release) in a
[Diego](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release) deployment.  Additionally, a VM is deployed to act as a network Policy Server.
A [JSON API](docs/API.md) and a [CF CLI plugin](docs/CLI.md) are available to control network policies.

For more information about deploying CF Networking, look at our docs for [BOSH-lite](docs/deploy-bosh-lite.md) or a cloud provider like [AWS or GCP](docs/deploy-iaas.md#deploy-to-aws).
